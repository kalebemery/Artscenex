# **Artscene**
## **Kaleb Emery**
#### *Software Development Bootcamp @ Eleven Fifty Academy*

The final requirement to earn the Red Badge for this program was to independently creat an MVC Application. My MVC, Artscene, provides users the ability to post artwork, create a transaction for desired art, and view artists and their work.
<br />
#### How to install the project locally:
<br />
<i>(This application was built and tested in Visual Studio)</i>
<br />
<br />
1.	Go to https://github.com/kalebemery/Artscenex 
<br />
2.	On this page, make sure you are on the master branch (located directly above the blue box containing the name of the last committed changes)
<br />
3.	Once you know you are on the master branch, click the green box containing “Code” and copy the URL given in the dropdown menu, either by copying the link manually or clicking the clipboard icon. 
<br />
4.	Now you can navigate to where you’d like the project to be stored, and open your command prompt. 
<br />
5.	In your command prompt, type “git clone”, put a space after “clone”, then paste the URL you copied from Github. Press enter and the project should clone to your local computer.
<br />
6.	After the project is cloned, if there are build errors then you may have to restore NuGet packages that come along with the project. Another solution may be restarting Visual Studio.
<br />
7.	Once the project is building with no errors, go to the search bar in Visual Studio and click on Tools -> NuGet Package Manager -> Package Manager Console.
<br />
8.	If the solution builds with an error, clean the solution, rebuild it, and try starting it again.
